# Introduction

Getting up and running with MILO-ML is simple as this guide will demonstrate.

The prerequisite for running MILO-ML on your own infrastructure is the software Docker. This is
currently our only distribution method that is supported.

For more information on Docker including download links please see [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

# Introduction

Getting up and running with MILO is simple as this guide will demonstrate.

The prerequisite for running MILO on your own infrastructure is the software Docker. This is
currently our only distribution method that is supported.

For more information on Docker including download links please see [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

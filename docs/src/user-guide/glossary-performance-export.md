# Glossary: Performance Column Definitions

This file contains performance information for each pipeline as well as the total run time for all pipelines. This file is useful when comparing run times with different hardware.

| Column | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| key | A unique ID representing the model identified. This key can be broken apart by `__` to identify the separate pipeline elements. The final row will always be `total` which represents the entire time it took to complete all pipelines. |

# Train and Test Builder

Splits a single data file into two separate data files.

In order for a dataset to be used in MILO, the data needs to be separated into a training / initial validation test file (from here on referred to as "Training Data") and a follow up "Generalization testing data". While this can be done independently, MILO offers a Train Test Split tool which allows you to quickly segment your data. This is how it works:

Navigate to the Preprocessing Tools from the MILO home page and then select Train and Test Builder.

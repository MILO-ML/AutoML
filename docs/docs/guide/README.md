# Introduction

## Welcome to MILO's Auto-ML platform

Through this step-by-step guide, you will be able to use your datasets to create machine learning models through MILO's powerful and fully automated binary classification platform. If you choose, the platform will also allow you to easily make use of these ML models for future predictions.

The guide will first walk you through the steps needed to acquire your data and structure it in a format that is usable within MILO. It will then walk you through MILO's user interface, step-by-step, to build the required models as you see fit.

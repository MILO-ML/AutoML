# Introduction

## Welcome to MILO

This guide will walk you through step-by-step to create a machine learning trained model using your data and allow you to directly use that model for future predications.

The guide will first walk you through the steps needed to acquire your data and structure it for input into MILO then walk you through MILO's user interface to build the required models.
